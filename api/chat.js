/**
 * Solid LLM website assistant — serverless backend (Vercel Node function).
 *
 * The site is static, so it calls this same-origin endpoint instead of talking
 * to a model provider from the browser. The API key lives in a server-side
 * environment variable and is never shipped to visitors.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript on purpose: this project pins TypeScript 7 (tsgo), whose
 * compiler API the Vercel Node builder cannot use to transpile a .ts function.
 * Keep the grounding context in sync with the solidai-platform copy
 * (packages/llm/data/knowledge.md and public/api/chat.php).
 *
 * Provider: OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai). Environment variables:
 *     OPENROUTER_API_KEY   (required)
 *     SOLID_LLM_MODEL      (optional, defaults to a capable general model)
 *
 * Request  (POST application/json):
 *     { message: string, sector?: string, history?: {role,content}[] }
 * Response (200):
 *     { reply: string, model: string }

Solid Solutions is a technology initiative focused on Africa's digital future. It
works on experimental AI and infrastructure projects, contributing to emerging
technical initiatives and early-stage technology development. Contact:
info@solidsolutions.africa. Website: solidsolutions.africa.

SolidAI is the applied-AI program of Solid Solutions. Its goal is AI that is
practical for the African context: understanding local languages and powering
digital infrastructure. It focuses on hyper-local NLP for diverse African
dialects, edge efficiency for low-power hardware, and a privacy-first approach
that keeps sensitive data within defined boundaries. SolidAI is in beta;
developers can request early access to its APIs and models via the beta program.

Solid LLM is Solid Solutions' language-model research effort, including a
transformer built from scratch in PyTorch. The current public research preview
is a small character-level model trained on first-party text - an honest
demonstration of the training and inference pipeline, not a large production
model. Research targets hyper-local NLP for African dialects, agri-tech such as
crop-disease detection, predictive models for inclusive finance, and edge
deployment on low-power hardware.

Sectors SolidAI advises on: agriculture (crop selection, soil, pests,
irrigation), health (preventive care, malaria/HIV/TB, maternal and child health,
access in resource-limited settings), education (curriculum, teacher training,
digital literacy, remote students), finance (mobile money, microfinance, savings
groups, financial inclusion for the unbanked), legal (land rights, business
registration, contracts, access to justice), transport (last-mile delivery,
public transit, rural roads, cross-border logistics), and energy (off-grid
solar, mini-grids, clean cooking, pay-as-you-go access).

Privacy: Solid Solutions collects only basic contact information submitted
voluntarily, uses it solely to respond to inquiries and share updates, and does
not sell or share personal information for marketing.
